            The Pug is often described as a lot of dog in a small space.
            These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club’s Toy group,
            and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they have a great sense
            of humor and like to show off. <br /><br />

            The Pug's comical face, with deep wrinkles around big, dark eyes and a
            flat round face, can't help but make you smile. It is believed that the
            Pug's name comes from the Latin word for "fist" because his face resembles
            a human fist.Pugs love to be the center of attention, and are heartsick if ignored.<br /><br />

            While Pugs can be good watchdogs, they aren't inclined to be "yappy,"
            something your neighbors will appreciate.If trained and well-socialized, 
            they get along well with other animals and children.Originally bred to be lap dogs, 
            Pugs thrive on human companionship.<br />
            They’re highly sensitive, and though they can make for great apartment pets,
            they will not appreciate being left home alone for long hours of the day.
            Although these pups have a stubborn side, especially when it comes to house training,
            they’re playful, affectionate dogs who will get along well even with novice pet parents.
            Due to the flat shape of the Pug's face, he does not do well in extremely hot or cold weather,
            and should be kept indoors.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
