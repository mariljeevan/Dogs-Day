               Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike.
               Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be
               stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.
               Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent.
               Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare.
               They’re still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States.
               But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.<br /><br />

               They aren't yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations — a bark/growl, a baying howl,
               and a half-baying howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization
               usually is reserved for when they catch sight of quarry — or think it's time to wake the
               neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well with other animals and
               their human friends — and they think everyone is their new best friend.<br /><br />

               Because of their small size and gentle temperament, Beagles can do well in apartments if their 
               people are willing to walk them on lead several times a day in all kinds of weather. They need 
               plenty of exercise, about an hour a day if possible. If left alone and unexercised, Beagles can
               become destructive.<br /><br /><br /><br />
