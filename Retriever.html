        A retriever is a type of gun dog that retrieves game for a hunter.
        But, they are typically used for waterfowl hunting.
        When hunting waterfowl, a retriever's primary job is to retrieve downed birds.
        At times, a dog will not see the game fall, so retrievers are trained to take hand, voice,
        and whistle commands from the handler directing the dog to the downed game for retrieval.
        This is called a “blind retrieve”.<br /><br />

        The temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed,
        and is described in the standard as "kindly, friendly and confident".
        They are not "one-man dogs" and are generally equally amiable with both strangers and those familiar to them.
        The typical Golden Retriever is calm, naturally intelligent and biddable, and with an exceptional eagerness to please.
        Golden Retrievers are also noted for their intelligence. <br /><br />

        Golden Retriever puppies make friends of kids, adults, and other animals
        while keeping their trademark smiles on their faces.<br />
        The average lifespan of a retriever is about 10–12 years. Some may live up to 15 years.
        Golden Retrievers are somehow both majestic and completely silly;
        they’re simultaneously big ol’ goofballs and compassionate listeners.
        Golden Retriever puppy eyes have some sort of magic about them. One
        look and an instant calm will probably wash over you; stress simply melts away.
